#student-directory

##Background##

This is my very first README.

It for a project I am doing as part of week 3 of my Pre-course work for the [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy).

This project so far includes;

- [x] Creating a repo for the Student-directory
- [x] Creating our own RAEDME
- [x] Attempting to write Markdown


## Student Directory Project Itself ##

The student directory is a script which allows one to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy. I am unsure if the Academy name matters at the moment so I am not changing it.  :shipit:

**The part will be bold**

This is how you input code.
```
ruby directory.rb

```
